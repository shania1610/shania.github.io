            <h3>Hobby 2 - Baking</h3>
            <p class="hidden">Baking is a method of preparing food that uses dry heat, typically in an oven, but can also be done in hot ashes, or on hot stones. The most common baked item is bread, but many other types of foods can be baked. Heat is gradually transferred from the surface of cakes, cookies, and pieces of bread to their center, typically conducted at elevated temperatures surpassing 300Â°F.</p>

            <p class="hidden">Carnival (Maltese: il-Karnival ta' Malta) has had an important place on the Maltese cultural calendar for just under five centuries, having been celebrated since at least the mid-15th century.[1] Carnival has been a prominent celebration in the Islands since the rule of Grand Master Piero de Ponte in 1535.</p>
